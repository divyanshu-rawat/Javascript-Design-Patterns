Anti-Patterns

If we consider that a pattern represents a best practice, an anti-pattern represents a lesson that has been learned. The term anti-patterns was coined in 1995 by Andrew Koenig in the November C++ Report that year, inspired by the GoF's book Design Patterns. In Koenigâ€™s report, there are two notions of anti-patterns that are presented. Anti-Patterns:

Describe a bad solution to a particular problem which resulted in a bad situation occurring
Describe how to get out of said situation and how to go from there to a good solution
